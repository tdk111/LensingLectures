# LensingLectures
=================

These lectures cover, that cover approximately 4 hours of discussion and presentation, cover the 
basics of weak gravitational lensing measurement. 

They cover 

- Weak lensing derivation from GR
- Presentation of the lens equation 
- Determination of the distortion matrix 
- Discussion of how this related to ellipticity and size changes
- Measurement aspects including KSB, model fitting, and PSF measurement 
- Mass mapping 
- Correlation functions 
- Power spectrum including 3d cosmci shear and tomographic derivation

These are aimed at undergraduate and ealry post-graduate level.
